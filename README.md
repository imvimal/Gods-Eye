# Gods-Eye
Gods Eye is a crowd behaviour analysis tool using Machine Learning and Data Visualisation techniques.
•	It is an application which tracks the crowd in a specific area by fetching the data from the CCTV camera in public places.
•	Existing methods typically model the counting task with open set, where they are likely to suffer from an unseen scene with counts out of the scope of the closed set. S-DCNet converts an open set problem to closed set. 
•	The fetched data is processed through an algorithm to identify the number of people. When the group exceeds the safe limit, it alerts the authorities who are in and around the area.
•	The main idea of this project is to analyze the CCTV visuals in real time for automatically sensing the crowd distribution and to provide statistical data to the users.
•	By linking the IP address of the CCTV in the website the connection of a new CCTV is made easily.
•	The end result of our system is a web and mobile app user interface where users can browse through a range of information related to the crowd distribution and crowd movement within a campus and a city.
